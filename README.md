# Simple-Todo

This is just a spare time project because I want to do something with Android and tensorflow.

## Idea

The idea is the following. Each time you tick of a task as done, the app will ask for quick feedback. 
Based on this feedback it should learn when you are most successful at certain types of tasks to prompt you at the right time
to finish the task.
